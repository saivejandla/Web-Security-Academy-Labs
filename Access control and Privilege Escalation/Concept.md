# Access Control and Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities

## What is Access Control?

<p align="justify"> 
Access control is also sometimes called as Authorization. It is the way by which the web application allows the users/ group of users to access different pages, content or functions across the application. In web applications the access control is dependent on the Authentication and Session Management. </p>

### Different types of Access Controls
#### Vertical Access Control
<p align="justify"> 
Vertical access controls are controls that provide limitation on sensitive functionality depending on the type of user. In systems with vertical access controls, different types of users have access to different application functions. For instance, an administrator could change or delete any user's account; for an ordinary user, such actions would not be available. The vertical access control could also be more granular in its implementation of security models, which are designed to implement such business policies as separation of duties and least privilege.

#### **Horizantal Access Control**
<p align="justify"> 
 Horizontal access control mechanisms impose constraints on accessing resources from selected users. In horizontal access control, different users would have access to a subset of resources of the same type. For example, in banking applications, a user will be able to view his or her transactions and pay from his or her accounts but not from the accounts of any other user.
</p>

#### Context-dependent access controls
<p align="justify"> 
 Some access control systems grant or deny access to application functions and resources based on the application state and the context of the user interaction with it. Context-dependent access controls prevent the user performing actions out of sequence. For instance, a retail website might prevent users from accessing or modifying contents of their shopping cart after they have already paid for those contents.
